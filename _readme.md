<h1>Welcome</h1>
Hello and welcome to my first GitHub repository, a nostr icon library.
<h1>History</h1>
Several weeks ago I created a very lame looking purple ostrich and added it to my website over at https://sats.coffee as part of my header for social media links. A few days after publishing, <a href="https://snort.social/p/npub1fl7pr0azlpgk469u034lsgn46dvwguz9g339p03dpetp9cs5pq5qxzeknp" target="_blank">@SovrynMatt</a> posted a nice version of a purple ostrich which he had purchased. After seeing his version, it made mine look like a pudgy roadrunner. 
<br><br>
However I wasn't 100% sold on Matt's version (no offense Matt!) because I didn't like the way the front foot was positioned in the air. I played around with a low-res gif hoping to export one of the layers, but ultimately I decided to create a new nostr icon from scratch.
<br><br>
Recently many people have been asking the community for icons, so I exported my file into several versions and have uploaded them here. 
<h1>Files</h1>
There are individual .png, .svg, .ico and .gif files here along with a zip file with all of the icon files. You can see the files included below this note. The running ostrich <i>is not</i> included in the zip file so download it separately if you want it as well.
<h1>RGB Value</h1>
As far as the purple color goes, I used RGB 169, 21, 255 and to help remember, you can type in 269 for the blue, knowing it will default to the max of 255.
<h1>Value for Value</h1>
<i>A gentle reminder,</i> if you find value in my icon pack, <a href="https://sats.coffee/our-beans" target="blank">please purchase</a> some fresh roasted, El Salvadorian, Ethiopian, or Javan-blend coffee beans from us and/or send some value back my way using <a href="lnurl1dp68gurn8ghj7cn5vdcxz7fwwdshguewvdhkven9v5hjuam9d3kz66mwdamkutmvde6hymrs9a6xjurnqwmgxn" target="blank">tips@btcpay.sats.coffee</a>.
<br><br>
Enjoy!
<br><br>
Â¡Pura Vida!
